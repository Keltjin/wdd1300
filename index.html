        <p>Hello my name is David Gjennestand and I am a Comupter Science major. I enjoy writing, drawing, reading, and creating stories. I love board games, video games, and card games. I am not married. Web design is a big part of the world we live in today. Everything we do on the world wide web is connected to a website that has been created by someone who is in web design. I am taking this course to help me learn how to create a website for a future buisnness I hope to create.</p>
        
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life. A quote I really enjoy is from President Nelson, "Each day is a day of decision, and out decisions determine our destiny." </p>
